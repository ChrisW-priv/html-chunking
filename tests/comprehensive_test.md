# Comprehensive Markdown Formatting Test File

This is some introductory text before any numbered sections.

# 1 Introduction to the Document

This is the first main section. It should become `##`.

# 1.1 First Sub-section

Content for the first sub-section. This should become `###`.

1.1.1 Detailed Point One.

A detailed point with a period at the end of its title. This should become `####`.

########## 1.1.1.1 Further Detail Point. Even deeper nested heading. This should become `#####`.

Some paragraph text here. We should ensure numbers like "version 2.0" or "GPT 3.5" are not misinterpreted as headings. Also, a reference like [1] in text should not interfere.

2.0 Another Top-Level Section Numbered as 2.0

This demonstrates a heading with a zero in its numbering, which is valid. It should become `###`.

### 3 Conclusion Section

This is the final main section before the references. It should become `##`.

Some more text to ensure processing continues normally until the references.
